## Hosting websites/homepages on GitHub Pages

You can host your personal homepage or group webpage
or project website on GitHub using
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/features/pages/) and
[Bitbucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/publishing-a-website-on-bitbucket-cloud-221449776.html)
also offer a very similar solution.

Unless you need user authentication or a sophisticated database behind your website,
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) can be a very nice alternative
to running your own web servers.

This is how all

material is hosted.
